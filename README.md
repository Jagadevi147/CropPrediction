This is my first mini project 
<br>
Analysis and Prediction of Agricultural Crop Production in India
Project Overview
This project analyzes agricultural crop production data across different Indian states and predicts future rice production using machine learning. The analysis includes:
Identifying top-producing states for rice, wheat, oilseeds, and sunflower
Visualizing crop production trends using bar charts and pie charts
Predicting future rice production using Linear Regression

Dataset
The project uses the ICRISAT-District Level Data.csv dataset.
Columns include:
State Name: Name of the Indian state
Year: Year of data collection
RICE PRODUCTION (1000 tons): Rice production in thousands of tons
WHEAT PRODUCTION (1000 tons): Wheat production
OILSEEDS PRODUCTION (1000 tons): Oilseeds production
SUNFLOWER PRODUCTION (1000 tons): Sunflower production

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
pandas - for data processing
numpy - for numerical operations
matplotlib & seaborn - for data visualization
sklearn - for machine learning (Linear Regression)


Installation & Usage
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-production-analysis.git
cd crop-production-analysis

2. Install Required Dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

3. Run the Python Script
python crop_analysis.py


Features
✔️ Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, duplicates)
✔️ Data Visualization (Bar charts, pie charts)
✔️ Machine Learning Model (Linear Regression for Rice Production Prediction)
✔️ Future Predictions (Predicting rice production for 2025)

Results
Top states for Rice, Wheat, Oilseeds, and Sunflower production
Machine learning model evaluates future rice production
Prediction for Rice Production in 2025

Future Enhancements
Add more crops and regions for analysis
Use advanced ML models (Random Forest, LSTM)
Develop a web-based visualization dashboard
